# Actual-Comp
The repository for the actual competition. Why have I been writing all these descriptions when nobody reads them?


Plan for this repository:
- Tidy up the Virtual League Code so it works on the actual robot
- Fix some logic errors adn get rid of the try-excepts
- Add to the Arduino code so that we can do the stuff we want


...I probably am alone in here, aren't I?

when im here, you will never be alone
